Walter White stood nervously in front of Gustavo Fring's desk, a figure wrapped in brown paper clutched tightly in his hand. Fring looked up from his paperwork and raised an eyebrow.
"What's that?" Fring asked, gesturing to the figure.
"It's... a collectible," White stammered. "I thought you might be interested."
Fring took the figure and unwrapped it, revealing a highly detailed replica of a character that looked suspiciously similar to Stewie Griffin.
"Where did you get this?" Fring asked, his voice cold.
"I... I made it," White said, his voice barely above a whisper.
Fring stared at the figure for a moment before placing it on his desk and turning his attention back to White.
"I don't know what you're trying to pull, White," Fring said. "But I suggest you leave before I lose my patience."
White nodded quickly and backed out of the room, the figure forgotten on Fring's desk. As he walked away, he couldn't shake the feeling that he had just made a huge mistake.
Walter White walked away from Gustavo Fring's office, feeling relieved to have escaped without any repercussions. But as he was walking down the hallway, he heard a strange noise coming from Fring's office. He turned around to see Fring's door slowly creaking open.
White cautiously approached the door and peered inside. To his amazement, he saw the figure he had just sold to Fring come to life and begin performing a comedy routine on Fring's desk. Fring, who was usually stoic, was laughing and clapping along with the figure's jokes.
The figure, who had Stewie Griffin's voice and mannerisms, was holding a microphone and making jokes about Fring's drug empire, his enemies, and his own uncanny resemblance to Stewie Griffin. Fring was laughing so hard that he was wiping tears from his eyes, and even his henchmen who were standing guard by the door were chuckling.
White realized that this was his chance to ingratiate himself with Fring and quickly walked back into the office. "Gustavo, I am so glad you're enjoying the figure. I can make more for you and your associates," he said with a smile.
Fring, still laughing, looked at White and said, "You know what White? You're alright. I'll give you a call next time I need some entertainment."
And with that, White knew he had just secured his place in Fring's inner circle. He left the office with a sense of accomplishment, and the figure, who was still entertaining Fring and his henchmen, was a distant memory.
The figure, who looked and sounded like Stewie Griffin, began its comedy routine with a confident swagger.
"Good evening, Mr. Fring. I see you've finally decided to get with the times and embrace the world of collectibles," said the figure.
Fring let out a chuckle and replied, "I suppose I have."
"Well, I must say, it's about time. I mean, have you seen the state of the drug empire these days? It's a mess. And who's to blame? Not me, that's for sure," the figure continued.
"Ah, but you're not the one running it, now are you?" Fring retorted, still laughing.
"Well, no, but I do have some ideas if you're interested. I mean, have you considered branching out into the world of meth-flavored ice cream? I think it could be a real hit," the figure quipped.
Fring let out a belly laugh and said, "I'll have to take that under advisement."
The figure continued with a number of jokes poking fun at Fring's business rivals, his henchmen, and his own uncanny resemblance to Stewie Griffin. Each one was met with laughter and applause from Fring and his henchmen.
As the routine came to an end, the figure took a bow and said, "Thank you, Mr. Fring. I'll be here all week... or at least until you get tired of me."
Fring was still laughing as the figure's routine came to an end. The figure then went back to being a lifeless figurine.
