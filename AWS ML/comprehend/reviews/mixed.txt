I am Jesus, and I have recently encountered a short angry man named Devin. It was a disheartening experience, as Devin's rage and lack of empathy made it clear that he was not fit for heaven.Devin's anger was palpable, his demeanor was hostile and he had no regard for the feelings of those around him. He constantly belittled and berated those who crossed his path. His behavior was unacceptable and it was clear that he needed to be taught a lesson.I made the difficult decision to send Devin to the underworld, where he can reflect on his actions and hopefully learn to control his anger and treat others with kindness and respect.It is my hope that Devin will take this opportunity to learn and grow, and that one day he may be able to redeem himself and join the souls in heaven. But for now, the underworld is the best place for him to learn and understand the impact of his actions on others. n conclusion, Devin's behavior was unacceptable and his anger and lack of empathy made it clear thahe was not fit for heaven. He has been sent to the underworld for reflection and hopefully, he will learn from his mistakes.
When the government finds out that someone is evading taxes, they can press federal charges against that person. This means that they could face penalties and even jail time for not paying their fair share.
